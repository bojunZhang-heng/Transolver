# Transolver for Airfoil Design

**Paper Correction:** There is a typo in our descriptions about evaluation metrics for the physics fields of volume and surface. The paper's reported results are MSE (not Relative L2), which is completely the same as the AirfRANS paper. We are sincerely sorry for this mistake.

We test [Transolver](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02366) on practical design tasks. The airfoil design task requires the model to estimate the surrounding and surface physical quantities of a 2D airfoil under different Reynolds and angles of attacks.

## Get Started

This part of code is developed based on the [[AirfRANS]](https://github.com/Extrality/AirfRANS).

1. Install Python 3.8. For convenience, execute the following command.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Note: You need to install [pytorch_geometric](https://github.com/pyg-team/pytorch_geometric).

2. Prepare Data.

The experiment data is provided by [[AirfRANS]](https://github.com/Extrality/AirfRANS). You can directly download it with this [link](https://data.isir.upmc.fr/extrality/NeurIPS_2022/Dataset.zip) (9.3GB).

3. Train and evaluate model. We provide the experiment scripts under the folder `./scripts/`. You can reproduce the experiment results as the following examples:

```bash
bash scripts/Transolver.sh # for Training Transolver (will take 20-24 hours on one single A100)
bash scripts/Evaluation.sh # for Evaluation
bash scripts/GraphSAGE.sh # for Training GraphSAGE (will take 30-36 hours on one single A100)
```

Note: You need to change the argument `--my_path` to your dataset path.

4. Test model with different settings. This benchmark supports four types of settings.

| Settings                                     | Argument      |
| -------------------------------------------- | ------------- |
| Use full data                                | `-t full`     |
| Use scarce data                              | `-t scarce`   |
| Test on out-of-distribution Reynolds         | `-t reynolds` |
| Test on out-of-distribution Angle of Attacks | `-t aoa`      |

5. Develop your own model. Here are the instructions:

   - Add the model file under folder `./models/`.

   - Add the training details in `./params.yaml`. If you donot want to change setting, just copy other models' configuration.

   - Add the model configuration into `./main.py`.

   - Add a script file under folder `./scripts/` and change the argument `--model`.

## Main Results

Transolver achieves the consistent best performance in practical design tasks.
